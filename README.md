# Miner

Different strategies to fetch data using reactjs and nextjs with miner

* CSR -> Client-side rendering means that a website's JavaScript is rendered in your browser, rather than on the website's server.

* SSR -> Server-side rendering means using a server to generate HTML from JavaScript modules in response to a URL request.

* SSG -> Static-site generation creates a number of static paths based on the data needed for the page. At build time, these many paths are rendered out into static pages, and served incredibly quickly to the client.

* ISR -> Incremental static regeneration enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site.
